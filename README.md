**Why did you make this?** I made it cause I didn't wanna pay money to remove the ads  

**How It Works:**
1. removeSponsoredBanner()
> Deletes specific banners, buttons, and dividers based on their class names or styles.

2. hook()  
> Runs removeSponsoredBanner() once to clean the page.  
> Uses a MutationObserver to keep removing unwanted elements if they reappear.

**What It Removes:**
> 1. Sponsored banners  
> 2. Follow, Discord, and Report buttons  
> 3. Certain dividers and floating elements
